1. To run the game, open index.html in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the player up, down, left, and right.
3. The objective is for the player to reach the water without colliding with any bugs. Colliding with a bug resets
   the game. Points are given for completing levels and collecting gems along the way!
